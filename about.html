                <p> 
                    The Penn Consortium of Undergraduate Women seeks to enact the systemic change necessary for the unbridled self-actualization of Penn's female students, faculty, and staff. We will always do our part to establish the institutional infrastructure within which women are empowered to reach their potential. We will take gender equity seriously, and will welcome the day that women ascend their own personal and professional ladders free of self-doubt and full of self-esteem.

                    Penn's undergraduate women's groups - those dedicated specifically but not exclusively to the institutional advancement of Penn women - once engaged in woefully little collaboration. In November of 2003, then-junior Jennifer Lane sensed that the synergistic potential of these groups might be quite powerful. She undertook the task of inviting each President and Co-Chair to join the Penn Consortium of Undergraduate Women. Thanks to their enthusiasm, we now boast more than twenty members and are a thriving activist force on campus. Our constitution is available <a href="docs\constitution.pdf"> here </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since its inception, the Consortium has organized three annual Women's Weeks with its constituent groups. The first Women's Week in 2004 was entitled "Engendering Unity." In 2005, acclaimed author Naomi Wolfe came to speak about the politics of body image, while in 2006, Gloria Steinem, an influential feminist activist, spoke about the future of feminism in America. For 2007, the Consortium has invited Frances Hesselbein, chairman of the board of governors of the Leader to Leader Institute and recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom (the United States of America's highest civilian honor) to be its keynote speaker. In all three years, the women's groups held very successful events of their own, which ranged from a student production of the Vagina Monologues, movie screenings, self-defense workshops, and speaker panels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to Women's Week, the Consortium has designed, developed, and printed a first-of-its-kind <a href="docs\undergrad-resource-guide.pdf"> resource guide </a> that caters to the needs and interests of undergraduate women. It is filled with useful information on various problems and situations that female students may need help in addressing, such how to handle sexual harassment by a TA or how to help a friend with an eating disorder. It also contains the biographies of the constituent groups in order to help undergraduate women find others with similar passions. The Consortium was greatly helped by the support from the Trustees' Council of Penn Women.
